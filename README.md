> **Started on:** July 4, 2025  
> **Status:** 🔨 In Progress  
> **Domain:** Entertainment | Recommendation Systems | GenAI

## 🌟 Project Objective

This project aims to build a **unique recommendation system for animated movies**—not just based on genre or ratings, but on **ethical values and life lessons** like *kindness, courage, family*, and more. The idea is to help users find meaningful, feel-good animated films that resonate with their personal beliefs.

## 💖 Why This Project Matters to Me

I'm a **huge fan of animated movies**—from the magic of Pixar to the heart of Disney classics. These movies aren't just "kids' stuff"—they've shaped my emotions, beliefs, and even helped me stay positive in tough times. Through this project, I want to combine my love for animation with my skills as a data analyst and build something *authentic, soulful,* and technically strong.

Whether it's *Simba learning responsibility, Elsa finding self-acceptance,* or *Luca embracing his identity*—these stories stay with us. Now imagine being recommended such movies based on what *you* care about. That’s the dream! 🌈

## 🛠️ What Will Be Done in This Project

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🎯 **Dataset Building** | Scraping and cleaning metadata of animation movies from TMDB |
| 🧠 **Value Extraction** | Mining ethical values from user reviews/comments using NLP |
| 🧩 **Recommendation System** | Building a value-based content recommender (unsupervised + keyword enriched) |
| 🧪 **Dashboard (Optional)** | Displaying movie recommendations using filters like values, decade, platform |
| 🧬 **GenAI Integration** | Using prompts to summarize movie messages or assist with value inference |
| 🌐 **Frontend (Future Phase)** | Interactive site where users choose a value and get 2–3 movie suggestions |

## ✅ Parts Completed So Far

- ✅ **Data Scraping from TMDB** (~30,000+ animated movies fetched)
- ✅ **Feature Engineering**  
  - Cleaned missing/nulls  
  - Created features like `release_year`, `is_short_film`, `decade`, etc.  
  - Finalized format as `Title (Year)`
- ✅ **Deduplication** and final dataset: `animation_movies_scrapper.csv`
- ✅ Planned ethical value themes for recommendation (e.g., Kindness, Perseverance, Courage)
